#  ZERATH UNIVERSAL ANTI-SCAM SCRIPT 

> _"We don‚Äôt play fair with scammers. We destroy them."_

Scam scripts are everywhere ‚Äî masked as ‚Äúautofarms‚Äù, ‚ÄúOP scripts‚Äù, or ‚Äúfree godmode‚Äù. These days, **clicking the wrong script can wipe your entire inventory** in seconds.

### üö® Enough is enough.

**Zerath Team** is here to **end this plague**.

We‚Äôve built a **UNIVERSAL ANTI-SCAM SCRIPT** that cuts off scammers at the root. Once executed, it **breaks every known trade system** in supported games. Even if someone tries to rebuild them ‚Äî **we break them again**. And again. And again.

- **"Your inventory, your rules. Not theirs."**
- **"Zerath watches what they can't even see."**

## üîê WHY IS THE SCRIPT OBFUSCATED?

To be crystal clear:  
This script is obfuscated **on purpose**. Why?

Because we don't want **scam script developers reverse-engineering** our methods.  
We know how these parasites work ‚Äî and we're staying 10 steps ahead.

But don't worry. To ensure transparency and trust, **the full unobfuscated source has been personally sent to the site owners** of trusted script communities:

- **scriptblox.com ‚Üí Thundermods** (sent source, already verified.)
- **robloxscripts.com ‚Üí Sirmeme** (sent source)

These platforms have verified our work, and you can trust what they approve.

### üß™ Required Executor Functions

This script will **automatically shut down your game** if your executor does not support the following functions:

| Function            | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hookmetamethod`    | Hook game-level metamethods like `__namecall`                           |
| `getnamecallmethod` | Retrieve method names in `__namecall` hooks                             |
| `newcclosure`       | Create protected closures immune to tampering                           |
